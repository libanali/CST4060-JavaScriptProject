    <h1>Graph for Concern for Wildlife - Manganese</h1>
     <div id="vis"></div>


     <h1> Describe any particule concern for the pipit or other wildlife </h1>

     <p> With reference to the concerns for wildlife, there is some data that shows some concern to the wellbeing of the wildlife in some of the locations. According to my research, there are many chemicals in the dataset that can pose a threat to the health of humans and wildlife alike. From my visualisations, I have discovered that some of these chemicals had increased through the years for some of the locations, specifically the later years. Furthermore, some of the data on the harmful chemicals have missing values which could affect analysis and predictions. Below, I will be discussing one of the two harmful chemicals: Manganese.  </p>


<h1> Manganese </h1>

<p> Above is a graph showing the value of manganese from the years 1998 to 2016 for Boonsri, Chai and Sakda. I chose these three locations specifically for manganese because they showed the highest value in comparison to the other locations. This chemical has shown a huge increase from 1998 to 2004-2005 for Boonsri, Chai and Sakda. After this period of time, we can see a decrease in the value during 2007 to 2009 for Boonsri and a decrease from 2007 to 2008 for Chai. From the graphs we can see that Chai recorded the highest value of manganese in 2004. We can see that from 2012 to 2015 for Chai and from 2013 to 2015 for Sakda, the value of manganese began to increase again. The visualisations are telling us that the value of manganese had several increases and decreases throughout the years for all locations. There is no data after 2015 which is a sign of concern for wildlife because the latest data shows that the value of manganese had risen rapidly and there is no telling if the value will increase tenfold in the following years or not. We can easily see this finding from the graph because the graph shows fluctuation which means the values are constantly increasing and decreasing over time. Furthermore, we can see that there is a gap in the data because there seems to be reading in the year 2016 for any of the locations which means that there is some missing data. Manganese itself isn’t viewed as a harmful chemical, but studies have shown that if animals were to be exposed to a high amount, it could affect their health. This finding would be considered insightful because many aspects were considered such as time, location and the measurement of the value. Features such as concatenation, faceting, selection and filtering were used to help me visualise and make the graphs a lot more interactive.  </p>



<h1> Concern for wildlife - visual effectiveness </h1>


<p> In this section I will be discussing the visual mapping of my finding and why I chose them. I will be discussing the marks, channels and attributes.  </p>

<p> As you can see in my visualisation for manganese, I used a line chart to help me discover if there were any concerns for wildlife in the present or future. As mentioned before, a line chart is used to display changes over time as a series of data points connected by a straight line. The chosen chart type for this the best fit for this finding because line charts were specifically designed to help users discover changes over time. This was very convenient for me because one of the attributes that were used for the visualisation was ‘sample date’ which gives information on the days, months and years. More than one mark was used in this visualisation and they are point (0D) and line (1D). The line was used to help me see the increase and decrease in the values. The line was used to help the user track any changes over time and the point was used to help the user identify specific values on the graph. The visualisation falls under the identity channel because of the way I identified the chemical by using colour hues. Colour hues are considered to be one of the best channels for categorical data as stated by Munzner in “Visualisation analysis and design” (Munzner, 2014). It states, “The most effective channel for categorical data is spatial region, with colour hue as the next best one” (Munzner, 2014). Although it is the second best, I thought a set of colours would be best way to highlight the story that I want the data to tell. There is one additional feature that was applied when designing these graphs and that was tooltip. Tooltip allows the user to display the values by simply hovering their mouse over the graph. </p>
