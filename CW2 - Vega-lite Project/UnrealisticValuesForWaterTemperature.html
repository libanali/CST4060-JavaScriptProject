    <h1>Unrealistic Values for Water Temperature</h1>
     <div id="vis"></div>


     <h1> Describe any data quality and uncertain issues, such as missing data, change in collection frequency, and unrealistic values </h1>

     <p> When navigating through the data I came across many problems with the nature of the dataset. I came across things such as missing data values and unrealistic data values for a variety of chemicals. I will be discussing both of these in detail. Unrealistic values will be discussed in another page. </p>


<p> Another issue within the dataset that was discovered was unrealistic values. When looking into different chemicals, I had discovered that there were some unrealistic values for water temperature. I created a graph that focused on a few elements and discovered that the water temperature in one location was abnormally high for some time. When going through the locations, I found out that Chai recorded an abnormally high water temperature between the years 2015 and 2016. The water temperature reached above 400 degrees which is impractical because this goes over the usual critical temperature, which could affect the wellbeing of the animals in the long run. Therefore, this data would be considered an unrealistic value. We can see this from the visualisation because there is a huge increase between the years 2015 and 2016. This could also be considered an outlier since the value in 2016 is abnormally far from the other values on the graph. Similar to the other visualisations, a mixture of advanced features was used to help me visualise my findings. Features such as concatenation, faceting and filtering were used to help me visualise the data. </p>


<h1> Uncertain Issues - effectiveness of the visualisation </h1>

      <p> In this section I will be discussing the visual mapping of my findings and why I chose them. I will be discussing the marks, channels and attributes.  </p>

      <p>  As you can see in my visualisations, I used a line chart to help me discover the uncertain issues. As mentioned before, a line chart is used to display changes over time as a series of data points connected by a straight line. The chosen chart type for this the best fit for this finding because line charts were specifically designed to help users discover changes over time. “All you need to know about line graphs” (EdrawMax, 2020) mentions why line graphs are useful. It states, “Line graphs are useful to better indicate the data changes over time in the form of easy to read interface” (EdrawMax, 2020). This was very convenient for me because one of the attributes that were used for the visualisation was ‘sample date’ which gives information on the days, months and years. More than one mark was used in this visualisation and they are point (0D) and line (1D). The line was used to help me see the increase and decrease in the values. The point mark was used to help the user identify specific values on the graphs. The visualisations fall under the identity channel because of the way I identified the different elements by using colour hues. Colour hues are considered to be one of the best channels for categorical data as stated by Munzner in “Visualisation analysis and design” (Munzner, 2014). It states, “The most effective channel for categorical data is spatial region, with colour hue as the next best one” (Munzner, 2014). Although it is the second best, I thought a set of colours would be best way to highlight the story that I want the data to tell. There is one additional feature that was applied when designing these graphs and that was tooltip. Tooltip allows the user to display the values by simply hovering their mouse over the graph. </p>
